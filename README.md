## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
- By this model we can understand the factors affecting the price for the house buyers in the Australian market.
- The Real estate firm wants to understand Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and How well those variables describe the price of a house.
- Dataset contains different columns like - 1stFlrSF, 2ndFlrSF, BsmtFinSF1, GarageCars, YearRemodAdd etc.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Lasso is the best regularization technique for predicting the house price with optimal penalty 0.0008.
- GrLivArea is the most important predictor for housing price.
